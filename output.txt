The output `1833` confirms that `nm-applet` is running in the background. This means the NetworkManager Applet itself is active, but it's not appearing or being recognized correctly by your XFCE panel.

Let's consolidate the troubleshooting steps, focusing on getting it to appear on your panel:

1.  **Carefully check the "Add New Items" dialog again, looking for generic indicators:**
    *   Right-click on your XFCE panel and select `Panel` -> `Panel Preferences...`.
    *   Go to the `Items` tab.
    *   Click the `+` (Add new item) button.
    *   Look for anything that sounds like a generic status area where applets might embed themselves, such as:
        *   "Status Notifier Plugin"
        *   "Notification Area"
        *   "Indicator Plugin"
    *   Sometimes, if one of these generic plugins is added, the `nm-applet` will automatically appear within it. Ensure you *don't* have multiple instances of these generic plugins, as that can cause conflicts. If you see more than one "Status Notifier Plugin" or "Notification Area", try removing all but one.

2.  **Restart the XFCE panel (if you haven't already or to re-apply changes):**
    *   Open a terminal and run:
        ```bash
        xfce4-panel --restart
        ```
    *   After the panel restarts, repeat step 1 to see if "NetworkManager Applet" or one of the generic indicators appears.

3.  **Check for an existing system tray or notification area:**
    *   Ensure you have a "Notification Area" or "Status Notifier Plugin" already on your panel. `nm-applet` often embeds itself within one of these if it's not a standalone item. If you have neither, try adding one.

4.  **Consider a full system reboot:**
    *   If the above steps don't work, a full system reboot (`sudo reboot`) can sometimes resolve stubborn graphical environment issues where new applets aren't being picked up correctly.

Please try these steps carefully, focusing on the "Add New Items" dialog and ensuring a proper panel restart. Let me know the outcome.
